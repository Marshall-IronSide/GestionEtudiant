# GestionEtudiant

## 📘 Description  
GestionEtudiant is a simple Java project for managing students (and potentially other related entities), intended as a school / academic project. The code is written entirely in Java.

## 🚀 Features  
- Basic structure for student management — add, edit, delete, list student information (or scaffold for these operations).  
- Clean project organization using standard Java directory structure (`src/`, etc.).  
- Ready to be extended — e.g., to implement CRUD operations, user interface, persistence, etc.

🎯 Goals / To-Do (Ideas)

Define a Student (or Etudiant) class with fields like name, id, grades, etc.

Implement CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for students.

Add persistence (e.g., using file I/O, serialization, database).

Add a user interface (console-based, or GUI, or web).

Add validation, search/filtering, and other features.

📝 Note

This repository currently contains only the basic skeleton of the project — no functional business logic or UI yet. Use it as a starting point and extend according to your assignment requirements.
